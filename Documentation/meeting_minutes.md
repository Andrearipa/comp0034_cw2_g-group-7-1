- if we don’t use the multipage we need to integrate more functionalities in the graphs
- using the multipage could add functionalities and allow us to focus on flask 
- ask sarah about whether to use the multipage and if we need to test the navbar, etc…

Features to include (work on the interactivity of the page and how people can access the data)
- login page → could be useful to store data 
    - have different user accounts (e.g. professional, student)
    - have a forgot password option to retrieve profile data
    - have the login / logout option available in every page of the app
- create groups / teams → most data takes into account 5 people when starting a business 
- option to login as a guest → if you are not a guest you can’t take advantage of additional features of the app
- add forum to comment and for people to share personal experience
    - add a rating on the forum comments so that the most popular ones stay on the top
- have a page with all the previous graphs that one has saved - to access them again and keep the same settings stored 
- have the option to share the dashboard (via link or email)

Other considerations:
- use blueprints
